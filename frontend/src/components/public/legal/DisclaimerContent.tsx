            Lakshya One&apos;s Phase 1 launch (Prayagraj district) includes
            school listings compiled from publicly available information,
            including each school&apos;s own website, other third-party
            websites and directories, and publicly accessible information
            available via Google Search and Google Maps.

            Information such as fees, facilities, admission dates, and

          Some listings on Lakshya One are compiled from publicly available
          sources, as described above, and are not yet confirmed by the
          school. Schools that register directly on the platform and
          confirm their own information are marked accordingly on their
          profile page. Where no such confirmation is shown, treat the
          listed details as publicly sourced and subject to change.
