        <h3>4. Data Sharing with Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p className="mt-3 font-body text-body text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          We use a small number of trusted third-party services to operate
          the platform. These services may process limited data as
          described below:

          <li><strong>Sentry</strong> — error monitoring; crash reports may occasionally include technical request data, which we take care to keep free of sensitive personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 font-body text-body text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">

        <p className="mt-3 font-body text-body text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Lakshya One uses session cookies to keep you logged in and to
          remember your role (Parent, School Admin, or Admin) while you
          use the platform. These cookies are essential for the platform

        <p className="mt-3 font-body text-body text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text. Session
          tokens for platform administrators are stored in HTTP-only
          cookies. Our database connection uses an encrypted connection.
          While we take reasonable steps to protect your data, no system
          can be guaranteed 100% secure.

          Lakshya One accounts are intended for parents/guardians and
          school administrators, not for children. Where a school profile
          indirectly references student-related information (for example,
          aggregate student-teacher ratios or total enrollment figures),
          this is general institutional data and does not identify any
          individual child. We do not knowingly collect personal data
          directly from children.
